# Design Transformation Project
## From AI-Slop to Authentic Design

### 🎯 Mission
Transform the Chill Amplify Template's frontend from generic "AI-Slop" design to authentic, human-centered design while preserving its core strengths: rapid MVP development and seamless Amplify integration.

### ⚠️ Core Constraint
**DO NOT BREAK** the template's revolutionary speed: 1-week web apps, 2-week MVPs.

### 📁 Navigation Guide

#### 1. Analysis (`/analysis/`)
- `current-state.md` - What the template looks like now
- `ai-slop-violations.md` - Specific violations of design principles
- `component-inventory.md` - Complete inventory of MUI components used

#### 2. Decisions (`/decisions/`)
- `must-preserve.md` - Core functionality that CANNOT change
- `can-change.md` - Elements safe to transform
- `implementation-strategy.md` - How we'll make changes without breaking things

#### 3. Progress (`/progress/`)
- `completed.md` - What's been transformed
- `in-progress.md` - Current work
- `backlog.md` - Planned transformations

#### 4. AI Memory (`/ai-memory/`)
- `critical-context.md` - **START HERE if you're a new AI instance**
- `lessons-learned.md` - Discoveries and insights from transformation work

### 🚀 Quick Start for New AI Instance

1. **First**: Read `/ai-memory/critical-context.md`
2. **Then**: Review `/decisions/must-preserve.md`
3. **Finally**: Check `/progress/in-progress.md` to see current state

### 📊 Current Status
- **Started**: January 28, 2025
- **Phase**: Initial Analysis
- **Next Step**: Document current AI-slop violations
