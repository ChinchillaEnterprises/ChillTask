## Architecture Breakdown by Author

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (feathars91)

#### Lambda Functions Created by feathars91:
1. **sync-slack-to-github** (scheduled cron job)
   - Polls DynamoDB for unprocessed SlackEvents
   - Downloads file attachments from Slack
   - Uploads to GitHub in organized folder structure
   - Marks events as processed
   - **511 lines** of production-ready code

2. **slack-webhook** (real-time receiver)
   - Receives Slack events via HTTP
   - Stores to DynamoDB with 30-min TTL
   - Fetches thread messages
   - Commits directly to GitHub
   - **647 lines** with retry logic and error handling

3. **get-slack-channels** (dropdown data)
4. **get-github-repos** (dropdown data)
5. **get-github-branches** (dropdown data)

#### Core Features by feathars91:
- **EventBridge Scheduled Lambda**: 5-minute cron job to sync messages
- **DynamoDB Buffer Pattern**: SlackEvent table with TTL for temporary storage
- **File Attachment System**: Binary file download → GitHub upload pipeline
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with request IDs and timestamps
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with 3 retry attempts
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration
- **GitHub API Integration**: File CRUD operations with SHA tracking

### 2. Frontend & User Experience (Ricardo)

#### UI Components Created by Ricardo:
1. **Channel Mappings Page** (src/app/channel-mappings/page.tsx)
   - Material-UI DataGrid with Slack ↔ GitHub mappings
   - "Sync Now" button for manual sync
   - Active/Inactive toggle
   - Real-time sync status display
   - Last sync timestamp

2. **Sync History Lambda** (syncSlackHistory)
   - User-triggered batch sync from "Sync Now" button
   - GraphQL mutation handler
   - Cognito authentication (later disabled for MVP)

#### Core Features by Ricardo:
- **API Route Integration**: Connected frontend to Slack webhook
- **GitHub Branches API**: Dynamic branch selection dropdown
- **Error Handling**: Production-ready error messages and logging
- **Authentication Flow**: Initial Cognito setup (later switched to API key)
- **Deployment Fixes**: Resolved TypeScript errors, OAuth issues, HTTP 431 errors

### 3. Critical Debugging & Fixes

#### Ricardo's Fixes (Yesterday):
1. **Lambda Environment Variable Error**
   - Problem: `getAmplifyDataClientConfig()` failed with "malformed environment variables"
   - Root Cause: Missing schema-level authorization
   - Solution: Added `allow.resource(syncSlackHistory)` at schema level
   - Impact: Enabled two-pass authorization system (IAM + GraphQL endpoint injection)

2. **Authentication Mismatch**
   - Problem: Lambda expected Cognito user but schema used API key
   - Solution: Disabled authentication check temporarily with TODO for production
   - Impact: Unblocked MVP development

#### feathars91's Fixes (2 days ago):
1. **Scheduled Lambda Access to Amplify Data**
   - Added `allow.resource(syncSlackToGitHub)` at schema level
   - Fixed same environment variable error for scheduled Lambda
   - Impact: Enabled automated 5-minute sync job

2. **File Attachment Support**
   - Implemented binary file handling
   - Created attachments/ folder structure
   - Added file download from Slack API
   - Impact: Complete message preservation with attachments

## System Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Slack Message
    ↓
[Slack Webhook Lambda]
    ↓
DynamoDB (SlackEvent table, 30-min TTL)
    ↓
[Scheduled Lambda - Every 5 min]
    ↓
GitHub Repository
    ↓
context/communications/slack/{channel}/{date}/messages/messages.md
context/communications/slack/{channel}/{date}/attachments/{file.png}
```

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Material-UI, Amplify Gen 2 client
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (Node.js 20), EventBridge Scheduler
- **Database**: DynamoDB with TTL
- **Authentication**: API Key (MVP), Cognito (production)
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager
- **APIs**: Slack Web API, GitHub REST API

## Critical Code Sections

### 1. Two-Pass Authorization System (Fixed by Ricardo)
**File**: amplify/data/resource.ts

```typescript
}).authorization((allow) => [
  // Schema-level authorization: Required for Lambda functions to access Amplify Data
  // This injects AMPLIFY_DATA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT environment variable into the Lambda
  allow.resource(syncSlackHistory),
  allow.resource(syncSlackToGitHub),  // Added by feathars91
]);
```

**Why Critical**: Without this, Lambda functions cannot access DynamoDB via Amplify Data client. This is the #1 most common Amplify Gen 2 error.

### 2. Scheduled Lambda (Built by feathars91)
**File**: amplify/functions/sync-slack-to-github/handler.ts

```typescript
export const handler = async (event: EventBridgeEvent<string, any>) => {
  // STEP 1: Initialize Amplify Data client with IAM authentication
  const env = process.env as any;
  const { resourceConfig, libraryOptions } = await getAmplifyDataClientConfig(env);
  Amplify.configure(resourceConfig, libraryOptions);
  const client = generateClient<Schema>({ authMode: 'iam' });

  // STEP 2: Query unprocessed Slack messages
  const { data: unprocessedMessages } = await client.models.SlackEvent.list({
    filter: { processed: { eq: false } },
  });

  // STEP 3: Process each message
  for (const message of unprocessedMessages) {
    // Look up channel mapping
    const { data: mappings } = await client.models.ChannelMapping.list({
      filter: { slackChannelId: { eq: message.channelId } },
    });

    // Sync to GitHub
    await createOrUpdateGitHubFile(...);

    // Download and upload file attachments
    if (message.files) {
      const files = JSON.parse(message.files);
      for (const file of files) {
        const fileContent = await downloadSlackFile(file.url_private_download, slackToken);
        await uploadBinaryFileToGitHub(...);
      }
    }

    // Mark as processed
    await client.models.SlackEvent.update({ id: message.id, processed: true });
  }
};
```

**Why Critical**: This is the heart of the system. Runs every 5 minutes via EventBridge, processes all unprocessed Slack messages, and syncs them to GitHub with file attachments.

### 3. Channel Mappings UI (Built by Ricardo)
**File**: src/app/channel-mappings/page.tsx

```typescript
const handleSync = async (mappingId: string, channelId: string) => {
  setLoadingSync(mappingId);
  try {
    const result = await client.mutations.syncSlackHistory({ channelId });
    if (result.data) {
      setSnackbar({ open: true, message: 'Sync completed successfully!', severity: 'success' });
    }
  } catch (error: any) {
    setSnackbar({ open: true, message: `Sync failed: ${error.message}`, severity: 'error' });
  } finally {
    setLoadingSync(null);
  }
};
```

**Why Critical**: User interface for managing Slack-to-GitHub mappings. Allows manual sync triggering and displays sync status.

## Conclusion

**ChillTask was made to work through true collaboration:**

1. **feathars91** designed and built the entire backend infrastructure, creating a robust scheduled sync system with file attachment support and production-grade error handling.

2. **Ricardo** created the user-facing interface, debugged critical production issues, and enabled MVP deployment by fixing the two-pass authorization system.

3. **Together**, they created a working Slack-to-GitHub archiver that:
   - Captures messages in real-time
   - Preserves file attachments
   - Syncs to organized GitHub folder structures
   - Provides user control via UI
   - Monitors production health

The system is currently running in production, as evidenced by the Ricardothe3rd bot making automated commits every few minutes.

**Final Answer: Both feathars91 and Ricardo made it work.** feathars91 built the engine, Ricardo built the steering wheel and fixed the brakes.
